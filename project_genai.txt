Building the Chatbot with RAG: A Step-by-Step Guide
Here's a general workflow for building your chatbot:

1. Data Preparation (Your Technical Book)
Load the Book: Your technical book will likely be in PDF, EPUB, Markdown, or plain text. You'll need libraries to extract the raw text.

For PDFs: PyPDFLoader (from langchain_community.document_loaders)

For other formats: Look into UnstructuredFileLoader, or custom parsers.

Chunking: This is crucial. Break down the book into smaller, semantically meaningful chunks. This is important because:

LLMs have context window limits.

Smaller chunks mean more precise retrieval.

Use a RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter (from langchain.text_splitter). Experiment with chunk_size and chunk_overlap. A common starting point is a chunk_size of 500-1000 tokens/characters with a chunk_overlap of 50-100 to maintain context across chunks.

2. Create Embeddings and Vector Store
Embedding Model: Choose one of the recommended embedding models (e.g., All-MiniLM-L6-v2 or an Ollama-compatible embedding model). You'll typically use the SentenceTransformerEmbeddings class (from langchain_community.embeddings).

Vector Store: This is where your chunk embeddings will be stored. For local development and learning, here are excellent choices:

FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): A highly efficient library for similarity search on CPU/GPU. It's excellent for local RAG.

ChromaDB (local mode): A lightweight, open-source vector database that can run entirely in-memory or on disk locally. Very easy to set up.

LanceDB: Another good option for local vector storage, known for its performance.

Process:

Load your chunks.

Pass them through your chosen embedding model to get vector representations.

Store these vectors (and the original text chunks) in your chosen vector store.

3. Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Framework: Use a library like LangChain or LlamaIndex. These frameworks abstract away much of the complexity of RAG, making it easier to connect your components.

Retriever: The vector store will act as your retriever. When a query comes in, the retriever queries the vector store for the top-N most similar chunks.

LLM Integration (Ollama):

Install Ollama: Follow the instructions on the Ollama website.

Pull your chosen LLM (e.g., ollama pull gemma:2b or ollama pull phi3).

In your Python code, you can integrate Ollama LLMs using OllamaLLM from langchain_community.llms.

Prompt Engineering for RAG:

Create a prompt template that takes the user's query and the retrieved context as input.

Instruct the LLM to answer the question only based on the provided context. This helps prevent hallucinations and keeps the answers grounded in your technical book.

Example prompt structure:

"Use the following context to answer the question at the end. If you don't know the answer, state that you don't know, and do not make up an answer.

Context:
{context}

Question: {question}

Answer:"
Where {context} will be populated by the retrieved chunks and {question} by the user's query.

4. Build the Chatbot Interface
Python Libraries:

Streamlit: For a quick and easy web UI for your chatbot. It's great for prototyping and learning.

Gradio: Another excellent option for rapidly building web interfaces for machine learning models.

FastAPI: If you want to build a more robust backend API for your chatbot, you can use FastAPI and then connect a frontend (e.g., a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript page or another framework).
